  title: How does agriculture affect wild plants?
  abstract: I became a scientist because I like to figure things out and solve problems. I started to become interested in herbicides impact on the environment when I began working in a lab at University of Michigan. The herbicide Dicamba poses many problems in agriculture because once it has been sprayed on weeds, it can evaporate and spread onto wild plants. However, because it is being spread in the air, it is affecting plants at a much lower dose than what is recommended in the field. This can lead to all kinds of unexpected impacts. By using the scientific method, I can observe how some plants react to dicamba and analyze how they express their genes differently.

  abstract: Lorem Ipsum is a term familiar to many designers, publishers, and communicators. It refers to a placeholder text used widely in the print and digital publishing industry when the actual text is not available. The origins of Lorem Ipsum can be traced back to the classical Latin literature from 45 BCE, specifically a work by Cicero—a Roman statesman, orator, and author—called de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (On the Extremes of Good and Evil). Over the years, the text has evolved, with various versions and lengths being used. Its purpose is to provide a natural-looking block of text, with letters and syllables distributed in a way that closely resembles the flow of human-written language. This ensures that the overall visual impression is consistent with a real-life document, allowing designers to focus on aesthetic and functional aspects of their layouts without being distracted by the content itself.

  bio:  I am a scientist and an activist. As a scientist, I study plant-insect interactions. Plants and insects make up the greatest number of described species on Earth, excluding bacteria. My research interests lie at the intersection of these two groups and how chemicals produced by plants influence their interactions and larger patterns of biodiversity. As an activist, I seek to bridge science and social justice advocacy by providing opportunities for knowledge exchange between academic researchers and incarcerated persons. I strongly believe scientific knowledge should be for all, and I hope to expand our work with bI/O and help establish similar programs at higher institutions around the country.

  bio: I'm interested in polishing treasures from others' trash. I like data dumpster-diving and studying the viruses that infect poorly-sampled, forgotten fungi. I argue that by studying these obscure organisms we learn fundamental truths that we could only have learned from these particular organisms. This helps me remember how representation shapes knowledge- an idea with implications that reverberate throughout our field and society.

  bio:  I am a scientist and an activist. As a scientist, I study plant-insect interactions. Plants and insects make up the greatest number of described species on Earth, excluding bacteria. My research interests lie at the intersection of these two groups and how chemicals produced by plants influence their interactions and larger patterns of biodiversity. As an activist, I seek to bridge science and social justice advocacy by providing opportunities for knowledge exchange between academic researchers and incarcerated persons. I strongly believe scientific knowledge should be for all, and I hope to expand our work with bI/O and help establish similar programs at higher institutions around the country.

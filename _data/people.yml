  bio:  I am a scientist and an activist. As a scientist, I study plant-insect interactions. Plants and insects make up the greatest number of described species on Earth, excluding bacteria. My research interests lie at the intersection of these two groups and how chemicals produced by plants influence their interactions and larger patterns of biodiversity. As an activist, I seek to bridge science and social justice advocacy by providing opportunities for knowledge exchange between academic researchers and incarcerated persons. I strongly believe scientific knowledge should be for all, and I hope to expand our work with bI/O and help establish similar programs at higher institutions around the country.

  bio: I'm interested in polishing treasures from others' trash. I like data dumpster-diving and studying the viruses that infect poorly-sampled, forgotten fungi. I argue that by studying these obscure organisms we learn fundamental truths that we could only have learned from these particular organisms. This helps me remember how representation shapes knowledge- an idea with implications that reverberate throughout our field and society.

  bio: I am a botanist, artist, and evolutionary ecologist. I study how morphology and anatomy influence interactions between plants and other organisms. I grew up on a small farm in upstate New York, where I developed a love for working outdoors and growing plants. I frequently express my love for biology through art and illustration, and firmly believe that science and art are closely intertwined disciplines.

  bio: Learning about the whereabouts of birds throughout their migration journeys is important to identify locations for conservation since many populations are experiencing declines. Range maps and geolocators are two ways to do this, and in my master's thesis, I compared both methods to see how well they characterized avian movement patterns. I also talked about my background, how I got to graduate school, and organizations I'm interested in working for when I graduate.

  bio: I am a scientist interested in how behavior evolves and develops. I study this using paper wasps that use individual recognition to manage dominance hierarchies and aggression. I've previously worked with meerkats, lizards, and turtles at Zoo Atlanta.

  bio: Evolutionary biologist specializing in population genetics. I am passionate about evolution education, the history and philosophy of science, and confronting misinformation about science. I run a YouTube channel (talkpopgen) dedicated to this. My research focuses on understanding ancestry and how organisms migrate across complex landscapes.

  bio: I am an evolutionary biologist who uses genomics to understand how speciation plays out in different landscapes (with a focus on Neotropical birds), and what that can tell us about the mechanistic basis of broadscale biodiversity gradients. My research utilizes specimens from natural history collections, so I am also passionate about building and maintaining museums as scientific resources and using museums for public outreach and education.
